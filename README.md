# FULL STACK DEVELOPMENT WITH PYTHON- TECHWAVE 
Hi we made this project during Full Stack development with Python Training program, conducted by <b> TechWave </b>.

## About the project :
This project is a simple url shortener. There is a sign in page. If not authorized shows '404 page not found error page'. After authorizing, it takes url 
from the webpage viewer and shortens it. There is a random generation of upto 6 characters(alphabet and numeric values). There is also a copy button to copy the new generated url. 
Original url, shortened url, number of visits on webpage and date is stored on the backend in a database.
